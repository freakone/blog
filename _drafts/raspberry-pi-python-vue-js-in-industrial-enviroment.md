title: Raspberry PI driven by Python and Vue.js in industrial enviroment
---

Seems crazy right? Using a most popular hobbyst microcomputer for an industrial appliances. As you may know at factories are really harsh for electronics. Hard working conditions is basically a certain. Dusty enviroment, wide temperature operation range is everyday normal for hardware used in industry. Maximum uptime and reliability is a necessity as those devices are usually taking part in processes that cannot be stopped or restarted in any moment. When this project started I had some serious dillema about main processing unit. The first obvoius choice is naturally PLC, but choosing it is kind of boring. I want to create pioneer, cutting edge things, not to copy someone elses solutions. My pick was naturally Raspberry Pi. Using it will not only test this ultra useful board in industrial enviroment but also give me endless possibilities in cofiguration and make wole system as elastic as I can imagine.

# The research

After some digging I failed at founding some described industrial projects. I only found some modules mounted on DIN rail, but some of them are stillin developing mode, some of them doesn't have all the functions I wanted:
